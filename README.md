# Healthy Snack Recommendation System for UK Kids

## Introduction
In this project, we build a simple recommendation system to suggest healthy snacks for UK kids based on their age and dietary preferences. This helps parents find suitable snacks for their children that meet their dietary needs.

## Dataset
We use a synthetic dataset that includes information about various healthy snacks, including their names, age suitability, dietary preferences, and nutritional information.

## Steps

1. **Creating the Dataset**: We create a synthetic dataset of healthy snacks.
2. **Building the Recommendation System**: We build a simple recommendation system using content-based filtering.
3. **Visualizing the Recommendations**: We visualize the recommended snacks using a bar chart.

## Results

- **Healthy Snack Recommendations**: List of recommended snacks for a 5-year-old with a vegan dietary preference.
- **Visualization**: Bar chart showing the calories of the recommended snacks.

## Conclusion
We successfully built a healthy snack recommendation system for UK kids. Future improvements could include using a real dataset and incorporating more dietary preferences and nutritional information.
